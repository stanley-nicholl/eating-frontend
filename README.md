# eat seattle

> Yelp is long overdue for disruption. The experience for the user is subpar, no longer maintaining a shred of rating integrity for 
restaurants. User's can no longer trust the source to provide an accurate assessment of quality food. Additionally, the business
model is reminiscent of 1950s mafia practices, shaking down local restaurants for money to remove the "bad" reviews.

Eat Seattle is a new kind of restaurant, binary in quality and aimed at the user exerience. No more ratings, if you serve great food
you're in, else you're out. Users don't have to concern themselves with reviews, if it's on eatseattle.surge.sh, they can trust
it's going to be good. Additionally, users can maintain their own private list of restaurants they want to check and which ones
really blew them away.

* Browse the top restaurants in Seattle and create their own "must" visit list
* Take notes on the restaurants, what did you like, would you go back, what was your favorite dish
* Always have access to your history
* Get points for going to restaurants, restaurants will be able to identify the active users and reach out to them (with permission)
